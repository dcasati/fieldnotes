# Understanding PACE and Its Importance  
   
PACE, an acronym for Primary, Alternate, Contingency, and Emergency, is a communication plan designed to ensure reliable and effective communication under various circumstances. It is a crucial component of any emergency preparedness plan, whether for a family, a business, or a military operation.  
   
## Primary Communication  
   
The **Primary** method is the most commonly used and reliable form of communication under normal circumstances. This could be anything from a simple phone call, text message, or email, to more complex systems like a company's internal communication network.  
   
## Alternate Communication  
   
The **Alternate** method is used when the primary method is unavailable or ineffective. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as network congestion, power outages, or simply being out of range of the primary communication method.  
   
## Contingency Communication  
   
The **Contingency** method is used when both the primary and alternate methods fail. This is typically a less conventional method of communication that can still be relied upon in difficult circumstances. Examples might include satellite phones, radio communication systems, or even courier services.  
   
## Emergency Communication  
   
The **Emergency** method is the last resort when all other methods have failed. This could be a dedicated emergency communication device, a distress signal, or any other means of attracting attention and calling for help.  
   
## The Importance of PACE  
   
The PACE plan is important because it ensures that there is always a way to communicate, no matter what the circumstances. It provides a structured approach to communication, reducing panic and confusion in emergency situations. By having a PACE plan in place, individuals and organizations can ensure that they are prepared for any situation, improving their resilience and ability to respond effectively to emergencies.  
   

| PACE | Method | Details |  
| --- | --- | --- |  
| Primary | iMessage and WhatsApp | Most commonly used methods of communication. |  
| Alternate | Phone calls | Used if the primary methods are not working. |  
| Contingency | FRS radios, Amateur Radio, Winlink, APRS | Used if the primary and alternate methods fail. |  
| Emergency | Zoleo satellite device | Used as a last resort when all other methods of communication are unavailable. |  
   
Remember, the key to a successful PACE plan is to ensure everyone involved understands the plan and knows how to use each method of communication. 
Regularly test and update the plan as needed.
